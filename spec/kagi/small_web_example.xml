        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I collect and organize useful data visualization (Data
            Viz)
            tools that aid data exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I illustrate the use of the tools via the classic
            &lt;strong&gt;Abalone&lt;/strong&gt; database, hosted on the University of California,
            Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning repository website.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Forecast combinations have flourished remarkably in the
            forecasting community and, in recent years, have become part of the mainstream of
            forecasting research and activities. Combining multiple forecasts produced from the
            single
            (target) series is now widely used to improve accuracy through the integration of
            information gleaned from different sources, thereby mitigating the risk of identifying a
            single “best” forecast. Combination schemes have evolved from simple combination methods
            without estimation, to sophisticated methods involving time-varying weights, nonlinear
            combinations, correlations among components, and cross-learning. They include combining
            point forecasts, and combining probabilistic forecasts. This paper provides an
            up-to-date
            review of the extensive literature on forecast combinations, together with reference to
            available open-source software implementations. We discuss the potential and limitations
            of
            various methods and highlight how these ideas have developed over time. Some important
            issues concerning the utility of forecast combinations are also surveyed. Finally, we
            conclude with current research gaps and potential insights for future
            research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
